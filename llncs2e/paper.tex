    %As utility of smart-phone arises, the security of smart-phone has become a serious problem.\\
    Losing smart-phones has become a troublesome thing as smart-phones are playing an important role in our daily lives. As smartwatches become popular, we argue that smartwatches can play a role in smart-phone anti-theft design. In this paper, we propose ABC, a real-time antitheft system that leverages accelerometers and gyroscopes of smart-phones and smartwatches to prevent smart-phone from stolen. As opposed to existing solutions which are based on Bluetooth, NFC, or GPS tracking, ABC follows a practical manner to achieve the goal of real-time antitheft for smart-phones. ABC recognizes taken-out events of smart-phones using a supervised classifier, and apply a dynamic time warping(DTW) scheme to recognize whether the events are caused by users themselves. We conduct a series of experiments on iPhone6 and iPhone4, and the evaluation results show that our system can achieve XX.X\% true positive rate and XX.X\% false positive rate.

  \section{Introduction}
  Smart-phones have now become very ubiquitous and of critical importance in our daily lives.
  As smart-phones are always storing lots of important personal information(even including credit cards), the security of smart-phones is getting more and more attention.
  A survey of smart-phone theft victims conducted by IDG Research\cite{lookout} shows that 1 in 10 U.S. smart-phone owners are victims of phone theft. In 2014, 2.1 million American consumers were victims of smart-phone theft.
  Smart-phone producers have also brought out some solutions to smart-phone theft\cite{shaun:jen}, such as "Find My iPhone" of Apple and "Android Device Manager" of Android.

  Nonetheless, these approaches including password mechanism and fingerprint identification are effective only after the crime, despite the Psychological influence(give up stealing) on criminals.

  Besides, Bluetooth technology are also employed for antitheft design before, in order to detect the crime when crime happening.
  But since Bluetooth can detect the crime only after criminal gets about 6 meters away at least(can be too late), both Bluetooth is not very effective in this scenario.
  %Security of smart-phones includes hardware security(avoid phones being stolen or crashed) and software security(avoid harm causing by virus or information leakage).
  Meanwhile, the majority of smart-phones and smartwatches contain abundant advanced built-in sensors to sense a user's movements.
  Sensor-based activity recognition has been studied extensively, especially for smart-phones\cite{hansong:liusheng,gary:jessica}.
  These researches focus on multiple fields, including healthcare[1~4], localization[5] and human computer interaction[6~9], but the field of smart-phone antitheft has been paid little attention.

      In this paper, we focus on the antitheft problem of smart-phones. We propose ABC, a system employing sensor devices on smart-phones and smart-watches to guard smart-phones from being stolen. ABC can recognize taken-out actions of smart-phones and check the sensor data of smart-watches to judge if the actions are caused by user themselves. The smartwatches will vibrate to warn users when ABC finds that the taken-out actions with high probability are not caused by user themselves.
      To reduce energy consumption, user can add a number of safe places in ABC system. When in safe places, ABC will enter a dormant state. Also users can switch ABC to the dormant state manually to stop the service.

      The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provides a system overview of our ABC system. Section 3 introduces the taken-out actions recognition part of ABC system, while Section 4 introduces how we judge if the actions are secure. In Section 5 and Section 6, we introduce the system implementation and the evaluation of our ABC system respectively. We present the related works in Section 7, and give a discussion in Section 8.

  \section{System Overview}

    In this section, we give a brief introduction of our ABC smart-phone antitheft system.

\end{figure}

     At the smart-phone side, ABC firstly acquires the accelerometer data and gyroscope data from smart-phones, which are organized in the form of triples(x, y, z) with corresponding timestamps respectively. Then we extract segments from the sensor data time series we obtain in the former step. In the third step, we compute a feature vector for each segment, which consists discriminative cues both in time-domain and frequency-domain. Finally, ABC constructs a classifier on smart-phone, it tells if there is a Taken-out Action. After a Taken-out Action is recognized, smart-phone side ABC will send a warning bit(signal) to smart-watch side since there is a potential risk that smart-phone is being stolen.

    Meanwhile, ABC does the same acquisition job and segment job at the smartwatch side. Right after receives the warning message from the smart-phone side, ABC apply dynamic time warping(DTW) algorithm to  measure similarity between two series of sensor data sequences from smart-phone and smartwatch respectively. Based on the similarity measured, ABC judges if the taken-out actions are caused by user themselves with high probability. At last, ABC will arouse a vibration event when a risky action is judged.
